# App idea

## Create a platform to express yourself which can be both in public or private.
It is completely anonymous, no persoal information is required except email to register.

## App usage policies
- Can post texts or photos
- For everything users posted online, others are not allowed to repost or save it to their phone
- Users are allowed to send private messages to others, however, inappropriate images/text will not be showcased and there the person who posted would be penalised 
- If one account does it for consecutive three times, then the account will be banned
- Users can set their account as private which means that other users cannot send private messages to them
- There is a ‘social’ function where it allows you to add your friends while remaining anonymous

## AI features
- Filters out the negative words & erase comments accordingly
- Identify the offensive/inappropriate images and ban them from sending out
- If there are too many negative words/comments posted by a certain account, the AI may be able to report the account or put the account under review
